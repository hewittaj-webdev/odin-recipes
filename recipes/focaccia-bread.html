        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy focaccia bread is flavored with plenty of fresh rosemary and olive oil. So easy, so delicious!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tablespoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C), or more as needed</li>
            <li>2½ teaspoons active dry yeast</li> 
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves stripped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 5 tablespoons warm water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the yeast mixture; stir well to combine. Stir in 1 tablespoon additional water at a time, if necessary, until all flour is absorbed and mixture has pulled together into a dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until springy, 4 to 6 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Lightly oil a large bowl. Place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 465 degrees F (240 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
            </li>

            <li>
                Deflate dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead briefly, then pat or roll dough into a sheet and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Brush with remaining oil and make dimples across the surface with your fingertips. Sprinkle with rosemary leave and extra salt to taste.
            </li>

            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven to desired crispness, about 10 minutes for light and fluffy or 20 minutes for crunchier and darker on the outside.
